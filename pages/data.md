<p>There are known corruption issues with downloading the metadata in CSV and opening it in Excel. If you would like to open a CSV file with Excel, here is the workaround:</p>

1.	Download the metadata as a .xlxs file
2.	Locate the file in the computer’s file explorer
3.	Open the file’s ‘Properties’
4.	Rename the file extension from .xlxs to .csv

<p>Then, the file should be a CSV file that can be properly opened using Excel.</p>

Alternative solutions: 
<p> a) Upload the CSV file to Google Sheets. Open with Google Sheets.</p> 
<p> b) Open the CSV File using Notepad / TextEdit.</p>
<p> c) On the Data page, download the file directly as an .xlxs file. Open and utilize as an .xlxs file.</p>" color="tertiary" %}
